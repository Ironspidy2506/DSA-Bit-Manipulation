## Introduction 🧠

In Java, we use the following bitwise operators:

- `&`  (AND) - Both bits must be 1 for the result to be 1.
- `|`  (OR) - At least one bit must be 1 for the result to be 1.
- `^`  (XOR) - The result is 1 when both bits are different.
- `~`  (NOT) - Inverts the bits.
- `<<` (left shift) - Shifts bits to the left, filling with zeros.
- `>>` (right shift) - Shifts bits to the right, maintaining the sign bit for negative numbers.
- `>>>` (unsigned right shift) - Shifts bits to the right, filling with zeros regardless of the sign.

Bit manipulation allows you to work on bits directly, leading to faster operations compared to arithmetic functions.
